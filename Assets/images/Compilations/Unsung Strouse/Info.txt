UNSUNG STROUSE: THE GREATEST CHARLES STROUSE SONGS YOU’VE NEVER HEARD WITH BETH LEAVEL, WILL ROLAND, AND MORE!
MAY 13, 2018
You’ve heard “Tomorrow” and “Once Upon a Time.” You’ve heard “Put On A Happy Face” and “Welcome To The Theater.” Now, as part of a year-long celebration of the man behind the music, The Second Act Series will open the trunk of one of America’s most prolific composers: three-time Tony Award-winner Charles Strouse.

Broadway’s original Eve Harrington, Penny Fuller (Applause, Sunday in the Park With George, A New Brain) leads a starry ensemble to sing never-before-heard songs by the legendary composer of Annie, Bye Bye Birdie, Golden Boy, and more. Audiences will discover songs cut from Strouse’s biggest hits, as well as music for shows that have yet to be produced.

Charles Strouse, celebrating his 90th birthday year, is one of America’s most acclaimed musical theater composers. A three-time Tony Award-winner, Strouse’s music has touched the life of almost every American in the last half century. From the classic “Once Upon a Time” to the rocking score of Bye, Bye, Birdie (Tony Award), his celebrated songs are an essential part of the American songbook. Strouse’s Broadway musicals also include Applause (Tony Award), Annie (Tony Award), Golden Boy (Tony nomination), Nick and Nora, It’s A Bird…It’s A Plane…It’s Superman (Tony nomination), Rags, and more. Strouse’s song “Those Were the Days,” one of the most popular television themes of all time, launched over 200 episodes of “All in the Family,” memorably featuring Carroll O’Connor and Jean Stapleton singing the song from behind their spinet.

Unsung Strouse is presented by the team behind the popular Second Act Series, Steven Carl McCasland and James Horan, who brought A Pound In Your Pocket, Mademoiselle Colombe, Bring Back Birdie, Shelter (starring Jon Cryer), Onward Victoria, The Fix, Henry, Sweet Henry, Charlie and Algernon, 70, Girls, 70, Nick & Nora, Eating Raoul, and more to New York’s hottest supper club.
